#### My selfbot aims to make general use of Discord easier for the everyday user. It adds features like the ability to send Tweets from chat and in the future I plan to add implementation with the Spotify API.

## Prerequisits
``node.js``,
``npm`` and
``git``

## Setup
### Step 1:
#### Run the following commands to clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mercys-stuff/mercy-selfbot.git

### Step 2:
#### Run the following commands to rename the `config.json.example` file to `config.json` and edit it:

#### In the areas provided, add your Discord login token and make any edits to the pre-defined prefix. You can also setup Twitter integration tokens which can be obtained [here](https://apps.twitter.com/ "Twitter Apps").
### Step 3:

```
